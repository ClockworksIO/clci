# Welcome

This is the documentation of [clci](https://github.com/ClockworksIO/clci) - a libary of tools and resources aimed to help in the workflow of build production grade Clojure applications.

## Overview

In this documentation we try to capture all knowledge required to use and improve clci.

You can find the documentation [how to use the library here](./userguide/index.md).

As part of this documentation we aim to keep all decisions made that influence this project as ADRs (Any Decision Record). You can find all ADRs created during the design and development of this project in the [ADR directory](./adr/index.md).
