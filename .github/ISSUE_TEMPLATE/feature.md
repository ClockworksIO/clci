_The Feature is a significant solution that will yield value to a stakeholder and plans the concrete implementation of this functionality. Its size is too large to be implemented easyly in the scope of what might be a sprint. Yet in difference to a Feature, the Feature can specify high level constraints for the implementation of the new functionality. A Feature is usually split into several smaller Stories._
