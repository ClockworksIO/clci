_An Initiative adds extra business value to the product. An Initiative is more abstract and focused on the value that the new improved product will give to its stakeholders. It does not make any assumptions how the new value is implemented and may only reference very high level constraints (i.e. related regulatory constraints). The Initiative can be the base for many Features (or in some cases directly for Stories)._
